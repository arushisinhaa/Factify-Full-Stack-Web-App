# Today-I-Learned-Full Stack Website
Today-I-Learned is an innovative project that aims to provide users with interesting and factual information in a user-friendly manner. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create an interactive platform where users can explore and contribute to a collection of facts. The main feature of the project is the display of facts along with their corresponding source links, ensuring transparency and credibility.To encourage user participation, Today-I-Learned incorporates a functionality for users to add their own facts. These facts are stored in a Supabase database, ensuring secure and efficient data management. By allowing users to contribute their own facts, the project fosters a collaborative environment and encourages the sharing of knowledge among users.

Furthermore, Today-I-Learned implements a voting system to gauge the interest and accuracy of the displayed facts. Users can vote on facts as either interesting, mind-blowing, or factually wrong. Based on the votes received, the facts are dynamically sorted from descending to ascending order. This means that facts with higher votes of interesting or mind-blowing are prioritized and displayed at the top, making it easier for users to explore the most captivating content.Additionally, the project incorporates a feature that highlights disputed facts. If a fact receives more votes as factually wrong, it is labeled as disputed. This helps maintain the integrity of the information presented and encourages users to engage in discussions regarding the accuracy of certain facts.

Today-I-Learned serves as a practical application for learning and gaining a better understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. By working on this project, you can enhance your knowledge and skills in these tech stacks while simultaneously providing a valuable resource for users to expand their knowledge and engage in intellectual discussions.

The future scope of the Today-I-Learned project includes the addition of a user authentication feature, which would enable users to sign up and sign in to the platform. This feature would enhance the project's functionality and provide personalized experiences for users.Furthermore, incorporating user authentication would enable users to vote for a fact only once. Currently, users can vote on facts, but there is no restriction on the number of votes they can cast. With user authentication, the system can enforce a rule that each user can only vote once on a particular fact. This ensures a fair and accurate representation of user opinions and prevents manipulation of the voting system.
